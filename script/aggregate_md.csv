Some of these rights will be held by individuals, some by groups, and others by political entities. This bundle of rights can be broken up, rearranged and passed on to others. The following is the typology: Secure tenure rights or tenure security Tenure security is the right of individuals and groups to effective protection by the state against evictions, i.e. under international law, \the permanent or temporary removal against their will of individuals, families and/communities from the home and/or the land they occupy, without the provision of, and access to, appropriate form of legal or other protection\. Security of tenure can then be defined as \an agreement between an individual or group about land and residential property, which is governed and regulated by a legal and administrative framework. A person or household can be said to have secure tenure when they are protected from involuntary removal from their land or residence by the state, except in exceptional circumstances, and then only by means of a known and agreed legal procedure, which must itself be objective, equally applicable, contestable and independent.\ Perceived tenure security refers to an individuals experience of his/her tenure situation or their estimated probability that their land rights will not be lost as a result of eviction by the state, land owner or other authority, or because of other factors that may cause involuntary relocation or curtail their use of the land, such as threats of land conflicts. Characterizing tenure status is based on four sets of interrelated parameters: \t1. Primary tenure rights on land \t2. Land tenure (rights of occupants on the land) \t3. Occupancy status (of the dwelling unit) \t4. Type of development Legal tenure security refers to the legal status of tenure and its protection backed up by state authority. De facto tenure security is based on the actual control of property, regardless of the legal status in which it is held. It can best be defined by the elements that compose it or contribute to it, such as the length of time of occupation, its socially accepted legitimacy and the level and cohesion of community organization. UNFAO (2003) defines Communally held land is where rights to use resources are held by a community. It refers to situations where rights to use resources are held and controlled by a community. While these rights may include communal rights to pastures and forests, they may also include exclusive private rights to agricultural land and residential plots. Local Communities A group of individuals belonging to the same community residing within or in the same vicinity of a particular parcel, property or natural resource. The community members are co-owners that share exclusive rights and duties, and benefits contribute to the community development. Indigenous land rights Indigenous land rights are rights specific to a particular ethnic group, having evolved through interaction of culture and environment and overseen by authorities whose legitimacy is based on occupation and spiritual ties to the locality. Community land rights Community land rights are collective rights of land ownership, access or use held or exercised in common by members of a community. A community may be designated as a village-based or more geographically dispersed community, or a clan or a lineage. Collective rights A situation where holders of land rights are clearly defined as a group and have the right to exclude others from the enjoyment of those land rights. Collective ownership of a natural resource refers to a situation where the holders of rights to a given natural resource are clearly defined as a collective group, and where they have the right to exclude third parties from the enjoyment of those rights. Common property Common property refers to situations in which entitled beneficiaries hold specified rights in common to specific areas of land, land-based natural resources or other types of property. Property / private property Property signifies dominion or right of use, control and disposition, which one may lawfully exercise over things, objects or land. Property rights Property rights refer to \a bundle of rights to use, control, and transfer assets, including land. These include the rights to occupy, enjoy and use; to restrict others from entry or use; to dispose, buy or inherit; to develop or improve; to cultivate; to sublet; to realize financial benefits; and to access services in association with land. Open access resources Resources  including land  to which everyone has unrestricted access and that are not considered to be the property of anyone. Ecosystem services: Ecosystem services are the benefits people obtain from ecosystems. These include provisioning, regulating, and cultural services that directly affect people and supporting services needed to maintain the other services.

Impacts of climate change on sustainable development are observed through both slow-onset events (e.g. sea level rise, increasing temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat and related impacts, salinization, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity and desertification) and extreme weather events. Human loss can be measured by the number of deaths, missing, injured or ill, evacuated, relocated, people whose houses were damaged/destroyed and people who received food relief aid as a direct result of the hazardous events.\n Cities are some of the most vulnerable areas to natural disasters. Unplanned urban development (e.g. informal settlements, overcrowding, inadequate infrastructures) exacerbates urban vulnerability to climate change impacts and hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. Over half of all coastal areas are urbanized and 21 of the worlds 33 mega cities lie in coastal flood zones. SIDS and coastal regions are particularly affected by sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis and storm surges) due to undermining natural protective barriers, low levels of development combined with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas and inadequate capacity to adapt.

The poverty reduction agenda could include well-designed social protection scheme to help protecting the poor against sudden shocks and the development of capacities to better predict and prepare for such shocks.

Missing: The number of people whose whereabouts is unknown since the hazardous event. It includes people who are presumed dead although there is no physical evidence. The data on number of deaths and number of missing are mutually exclusive. Affected people: People who are affected by a hazardous event. Comment: People can be affected directly or indirectly. Affected people may experience short-term or long-term consequences to their lives, livelihoods or health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. Directly affected: People who have suffered injury, illness or other health effects; who were evacuated, displaced, relocated; or have suffered direct damage to their livelihoods, economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. Indirectly affected: People who have suffered consequences, other than or in addition to direct effects, over time due to disruption or changes in economy, critical infrastructures, basic services, commerce, work or social, health and physiological consequences. In this indicator, given the difficulties in assessing the full range of all affected (directly and indirectly), UNISDR proposes the use of an indicator that would estimate \directly affected\ as a proxy for the number of affected. This indicator, while not perfect, comes from data widely available and could be used consistently across countries and over time to measure the achievement of the Target B. From the perspective of data availability and measurability, it is proposed to build a composite indicator which consists of \directly affected\, or those who are \tInjured or ill, \tEvacuated, \tRelocated and to measure the number who suffered direct damage to their livelihoods or assets, \tPeople whose houses were damaged or destroyed \tPeople who received food relief aid. Injured or ill: The number of people suffering from physical injuries, trauma or cases of disease requiring immediate medical assistance as a direct result of a hazardous event. Evacuated: The number of people who temporarily moved from where they were (including their place of residence, work places, schools and hospitals) to safer locations in order to ensure their safety. Relocated: The number of people who moved permanently from their homes to new sites due to hazardous event. Note: This definition excludes preventive relocation before the event. People whose houses were damaged or destroyed due to hazardous events: The estimated number of inhabitants previously living in the houses (housing units) damaged or destroyed. All the inhabitants of these houses (housing units) are assumed to be affected being in their dwelling or by direct consequence of the destruction/damage to their housings (housing units). An average number of inhabitants per house (housing unit) in the country can be used to estimate the value. Houses destroyed: Houses (housing units) levelled, buried, collapsed, washed away or damaged to the extent that they are no longer habitable. Houses damaged: Houses (housing units) with minor damage, not structural or architectural, which may continue to be habitable, although they may require some repair or cleaning. People who received food relief aid: The number of persons who received food /nutrition, by government or as humanitarian aid, during or in the aftermath of a hazardous event. Hazardous event: The occurrence of a natural or human-induced phenomenon in a particular place during a particular period of time due to the existence of a hazard. Hazard: A potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon or human activity that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. UNISDR recommends setting NO threshold for recording hazardous event in order to monitor all hazardous events. Small-scale but frequent hazardous events that are not registered in international disaster loss databases account for an important share of damages and losses when they are combined, and often go unnoticed by the national and international community.

UNISDR and IRDR groups recommend using them as they can be estimated from widely available and verifiable data and reflect vulnerability and livelihood issues. Data on housing damage and destroyed is essential for economic loss, so using these indicators would not impose additional data collection burden.

Better management of natural resources can themselves strengthen the resilience of the poor, by both reducing the likelihood of natural hazardous events and offering resources to help cope with them. The environment for food production is increasingly challenging, particularly for smallholders, due to environmental and climate-related factors. Similar to extreme income poverty, food insecurity continues to be predominantly concentrated in rural areas of developing countries, and disproportionately affects poor farmers, agricultural workers, pastoralists and rural communities. Common conditions for protracted crisis situations include frequent or continued exposure to shocks that undermine livelihoods, food and market systems. Special consideration needs to be given to population living in areas prone to environmental and natural disaster shocks.

The monetary value of total or partial destruction of physical assets existing in the affected area. Examples include loss to physical assets such as damaged housings, factories and infrastructure. Direct losses usually happen during the event or within the first few hours after the event and are often assessed soon after the event to estimate recovery cost and claim insurance payments. These are tangible and relatively easy to measure. Direct Economic loss in this indicator framework consists of agriculture loss, damage to industrial and commercial facilities, damage to housings and critical infrastructures. \tWe limit the economic loss into direct economic loss, excluding indirect loss (e.g. loss due to interrupted production) and macro-economic loss.

In addition, global/local on urban transport systems do not exist. Moreover, data is not harmonized and comparable at the world level. \n\t\tTo obtain this data will require collecting it at municipal/city level with serious deficiencies in some areas such as data on mass transit and on transport infrastructure. \n\tThe European Commission, on the contrary, considers that this is a good indicator which can be collected in a relatively straightforward way (DG REGIO, 2015). The assessment of the indicator done by the EC applies only for cities in the developed world, and not all. \n\tThe EC document highlights that the indicator was calculated for 80 European cities and stresses that the estimation requires the following data availability: (1) geo-coded public transport stops and the number of departures at each stop, (2) a high resolution GIS layer with population (for example census enumeration areas or a population grid) and (3) a street network (if available). \n\tHowever, these data requirements are not available in most middle income countries.\n\tUN-Habitat disagrees with this rating. This is a very relevant indicator. It is empirically proven that public transport makes cities more inclusive, safe and sustainable. \n\tEffective and low-cost transportation for mobility is critical for urban poverty and inequalities reduction, and economic development because it provides access to jobs, health care, education services and other public goods. \n\tClean Public transport is very efficient for the reduction of C02 emissions and therefore it contributes to climate change.",http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-11.pdf,4,"Proportion of population that has convenient access to public transport, by sex, age and persons with disabilities","By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons.","\tThe indicator is suitable, particularly in the countries/cities where the information exists.

This reduces the complexity of the 20 minutes (which is very variable in different hours of the day or days of the week). \tIn case there is no spatial information on the population location and density, the indicator can measure the proportion of the surface that has a public transit stop. \tAs cities/countries evolve in their data collection systems, the indicator could be harmonized to include the elements indicated by the EC (street network and frequency of the transport).",null,null,,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,,null,,null,null,null,null,null,,0,0

Impacts of climate change on sustainable development are observed through both slow-onset events (e.g. sea level rise, increasing temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat and related impacts, salinization, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity and desertification) and extreme weather events. Human loss can be measured by the number of deaths, missing, injured or ill, evacuated, relocated, people whose houses were damaged/destroyed and people who received food relief aid as a direct result of the hazardous events. \nCities are some of the most vulnerable areas to natural disasters. Unplanned urban development (e.g. informal settlements, overcrowding, inadequate infrastructures) exacerbates urban vulnerability to climate change impacts and hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. Over half of all coastal areas are urbanized and 21 of the worlds 33 mega cities lie in coastal flood zones. SIDS and coastal regions are particularly affected by sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis and storm surges) due to undermining natural protective barriers, low levels of development combined with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas and inadequate capacity to adapt. Poor urban populations must often resort to unsustainable coping strategies and mechanisms. \nLarge numbers of people remain perilously close to falling into poverty, experiencing shocks that they are unable to cope with. For the poor, a shock of even a relatively short duration can have long term consequences. Several dimensions of poverty are closely related to environment, which is often affected by natural disasters. The poverty reduction agenda could include well-designed social protection scheme to help protecting the poor against sudden shocks and the development of capacities to better predict and prepare for such shocks. Better management of natural resources can themselves strengthen the resilience of the poor, by both reducing the likelihood of natural hazardous events and offering resources to help cope with them. Biodiversity provides ecosystem resilience and contributes to the ability to respond to unpredictable global changes and natural disasters. Healthy ecosystems act as buffers against natural hazards, providing valuable yet underutilized approaches for climate change adaptation, enhancing natural resilience and reducing the vulnerability of people, for example to floods and the effects of land degradation. These ecosystem services improve the sustainability and economic efficiency of built infrastructure, and are critical for sustainable and resilient urban areas. \nThis indicator will track human-related loss. The disaster loss data (particularly mortality) are significantly influenced by large-scale catastrophic event, which represent important outliers. UNISDR recommends countries to report the data by event, so complementary analysis can be done by both including and excluding such catastrophic events. \nThe indicator will build bridge between SDGs and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction because the reduction of human related loss is included in the Sendai Framework global targets and will also be monitored under the Sendai Framework Monitoring Mechanism. \n(mainly based on TST Issue Brief 2, 5, 20 and 23-26)",http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-11.pdf,7,"Number of deaths, missing persons and persons affected by disaster per 100,000 people","By 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to global gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations.","Death: The number of people who died during the disaster, or directly after, as a direct result of the hazardous event Missing: The number of people whose whereabouts is unknown since the hazardous event. It includes people who are presumed dead although there is no physical evidence. The data on number of deaths and number of missing are mutually exclusive. Affected people: People who are affected by a hazardous event. Comment: People can be affected directly or indirectly. Affected people may experience short-term or long-term consequences to their lives, livelihoods or health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. Directly affected: People who have suffered injury, illness or other health effects; who were evacuated, displaced, relocated; or have suffered direct damage to their livelihoods, economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. Indirectly affected: People who have suffered consequences, other than or in addition to direct effects, over time due to disruption or changes in economy, critical infrastructures, basic services, commerce, work or social, health and physiological consequences. In this indicator, given the difficulties in assessing the full range of all affected (directly and indirectly), UNISDR proposes the use of an indicator that would estimate \directly affected\ as a proxy for the number of affected. This indicator, while not perfect, comes from data widely available and could be used consistently across countries and over time to measure the achievement of the Target B. From the perspective of data availability and measurability, it is proposed to build a composite indicator which consists of \directly affected\, or those who are \tInjured or ill, \tEvacuated, \tRelocated and to measure the number who suffered direct damage to their livelihoods or assets, \tPeople whose houses were damaged or destroyed \tPeople who received food relief aid. Injured or ill: The number of people suffering from physical injuries, trauma or cases of disease requiring immediate medical assistance as a direct result of a hazardous event. Evacuated: The number of people who temporarily moved from where they were (including their place of residence, work places, schools and hospitals) to safer locations in order to ensure their safety. Relocated: The number of people who moved permanently from their homes to new sites due to hazardous event. Note: This definition excludes preventive relocation before the event. People whose houses were damaged or destroyed due to hazardous events: The estimated number of inhabitants previously living in the houses (housing units) damaged or destroyed. All the inhabitants of these houses (housing units) are assumed to be affected being in their dwelling or by direct consequence of the destruction/damage to their housings (housing units). An average number of inhabitants per house (housing unit) in the country can be used to estimate the value. Houses destroyed: Houses (housing units) levelled, buried, collapsed, washed away or damaged to the extent that they are no longer habitable. Houses damaged: Houses (housing units) with minor damage, not structural or architectural, which may continue to be habitable, although they may require some repair or cleaning. People who received food relief aid: The number of persons who received food /nutrition, by government or as humanitarian aid, during or in the aftermath of a hazardous event. Hazardous event: The occurrence of a natural or human-induced phenomenon in a particular place during a particular period of time due to the existence of a hazard. Hazard: A potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon or human activity that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. UNISDR recommends setting NO threshold for recording hazardous event in order to monitor all hazardous events. Small-scale but frequent hazardous events that are not registered in international disaster loss databases account for an important share of damages and losses when they are combined, and often go unnoticed by the national and international community. These events, when accumulated, are often a source of poverty in developing countries but can be effectively addressed by well-designed policies. The scope of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 is \the risk of small-scale and large-scale, frequent and infrequent, sudden and slow-onset disasters, caused by natural or man-made hazards as well as relate environmental, technological and biological hazards and risks\. Regarding the inclusion of biological and environmental hazards in natural hazards category and whether and how to integrate man-made hazards, UNISDR will discuss the issue with WHO and other organizations (for example, WHO would be in a better position in terms of data, knowledge and relationship with Member States and other stakeholders to monitor biological events including epidemics.

Impacts of climate change on sustainable development are observed through both slow-onset events (e.g. sea level rise, increasing temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat and related impacts, salinization, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity and desertification) and extreme weather events. The economic loss indicator would track loss to agricultural, industrial and commercial sectors and damage to housing and critical infrastructure. Cities are some of the most vulnerable areas to natural disasters. Unplanned urban development (e.g. informal settlements, overcrowding, inadequate infrastructures) exacerbates urban vulnerability to climate change impacts and hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. Over half of all coastal areas are urbanized and 21 of the worlds 33 mega cities lie in coastal flood zones. SIDS and coastal regions are particularly affected by sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis and storm surges) due to undermining natural protective barriers, low levels of development combined with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas and inadequate capacity to adapt. Poor urban populations must often resort to unsustainable coping strategies and mechanisms. Large numbers of people remain perilously close to falling into poverty, experiencing shocks that they are unable to cope with. For the poor, a shock of even a relatively short duration can have long term consequences. Several dimensions of poverty are closely related to environment, which is often affected by natural disasters. The poverty reduction agenda could include well-designed social protection scheme to help protecting the poor against sudden shocks and the development of capacities to better predict and prepare for such shocks. Better management of natural resources can themselves strengthen the resilience of the poor, by both reducing the likelihood of natural hazardous events and offering resources to help cope with them. The environment for food production is increasingly challenging, particularly for smallholders, due to environmental and climate-related factors. Similar to extreme income poverty, food insecurity continues to be predominantly concentrated in rural areas of developing countries, and disproportionately affects poor farmers, agricultural workers, pastoralists and rural communities. Common conditions for protracted crisis situations include frequent or continued exposure to shocks that undermine livelihoods, food and market systems. Special consideration needs to be given to population living in areas prone to environmental and natural disaster shocks. Biodiversity provides ecosystem resilience and contributes to the ability to respond to unpredictable global changes and natural disasters. Healthy ecosystems act as buffers against natural hazards, providing valuable yet underutilized approaches for climate change adaptation, enhancing natural resilience and reducing the vulnerability of people, for example to floods and the effects of land degradation. These ecosystem services improve the sustainability and economic efficiency of built infrastructure, and are critical for sustainable and resilient urban areas. This indicator will track direct physical loss expressed in economic term. The disaster loss data (particularly mortality) are significantly influenced by large-scale catastrophic event, which represent important outliers. UNISDR recommends countries to report the data by event, so complementary analysis can be done by both including and excluding such catastrophic events. The indicator will build bridge between SDGs and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction because the reduction of direct economic loss is included in the Sendai Framework global targets and will also be monitored under the Sendai Framework Monitoring Mechanism.

The monetary value of total or partial destruction of physical assets existing in the affected area. Examples include loss to physical assets such as damaged housings, factories and infrastructure. Direct losses usually happen during the event or within the first few hours after the event and are often assessed soon after the event to estimate recovery cost and claim insurance payments. These are tangible and relatively easy to measure. Direct Economic loss in this indicator framework consists of agriculture loss, damage to industrial and commercial facilities, damage to housings and critical infrastructures. \tWe limit the economic loss into direct economic loss, excluding indirect loss (e.g. loss due to interrupted production) and macro-economic loss. The reason is that there is not yet universally standardized methodology to measure indirect and macro-economic loss while direct loss data monitoring is relatively simpler and more standardized. Global gross domestic product: Summation of GDP of Countries. GDP definition according to the World Bank. Hazardous event: The occurrence of a natural or human-induced phenomenon in a particular place during a particular period of time due to the existence of a hazard. Hazard: A potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon or human activity that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. UNISDR recommends setting NO threshold for recording hazardous event in order to monitor all hazardous events. Small-scale but frequent hazardous events that are not registered in international disaster loss databases account for an important share of damages and losses when they are combined, and often go unnoticed by the national and international community. These events, when accumulated, are often a source of poverty in developing countries but can be effectively addressed by well-designed policies. The scope of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 is \the risk of small-scale and large-scale, frequent and infrequent, sudden and slow-onset disasters, caused by natural or man-made hazards as well as relate environmental, technological and biological hazards and risks\.

WHO air quality guidelines provide specific recommendations on the mean levels of fine particulate matter which can support measuring the per capita health impacts related to any improvements or degradation in air quality in cities. Incidents of high air pollution levels also have health impacts, but these are less important than longer term exposures, and related statistics are less reliable in view of greater variability due to external factors, we therefore do recommend a more specific articulation of this indicator to as annual means as a way to monitor SDG achievement. Fine particulate matter: Fine particulate matter (i.e. PM2.5) can be directly linked to estimates of health risks. Coarse particulate matter (i.e. PM10) measurements can be converted to PM2.5, but will inherently introduce additional uncertainty to estimates of impacts (e.g. health). Articulating this indicator to fine particulate matter increases its specificity and its relevance for monitoring the health impacts of sustainable development policies. Population weighted: The population size of cities vary within a country. Weighting annual mean air quality measurements of fine PM by the city population size relative to other cities in a country increases the suitability and measurability of this indicator at a national scale.

Public spaces encompass a range of environments including streets, sidewalks squares, gardens, parks, conservation areas. Each public space has its own spatial, historic, environmental, social and economic features. They can be publically or privately managed. Public Space: Having sufficient public space allows cities and regions to function efficiently and equitably. Reduced amounts of public space impact negatively on quality of life, social inclusion, infrastructure development, environmental sustainable and productivity. It is documented that well designed and maintained streets and public spaces result in lower crime and violence. Making space for formal and informal economic activities, recovering and maintaining public spaces for a diversity of users in a positive way, and making services and opportunities available to marginalized residents, enhance social cohesion and economic security. Uncontrolled rapid urbanization generally creates settlement patterns with dangerously low proportions of public space. As a result, these places are unable to accommodate safe pedestrian and vehicular rights of way, land for critical infrastructure like water, sewerage and waste collection, recreational spaces, green areas and parks that contribute to social cohesion and protected ecological hotspots and corridors. As new cities also develop they have reduced allocations of land for public space especially streets. On average, at 15% the land allocated to streets in new planned areas is substantially less than the standard and in unplanned areas the situation is considerably worse with an average of 2%. The generally accepted minimum standard for public space in higher density settlements (150 inhabitants or more per/hectare) is 45% (30% for streets and sidewalks and 15% for open public space).Total city space refers to the built-up area of the city. The proportion of urban areas dedicated to streets and public spaces is a crucial feature of the spatial plans of cities. The road network is the integrative and dynamic factor between individuals and socioeconomic activities. It is a structuring component of geographic space and defines the socio-dynamics of an area being conditioned by the spatial pattern, which restricts the location of roads and human settlements. Short and direct pedestrian and cycling routes require highly connected network of paths and streets around small, permeable blocks. These features are primarily important for walking and for transit station accessibility, which can be easily discouraged by detours.A prosperous city seeks a tight network of paths and streets offering multiple routes to many destinations that also make walking and cycling trips varied and enjoyable. In fact, cities that have adequate streets, public spaces and greater connectivity are more liveable and productive. The use of this indicator aims to integrate urban form and spatial analysis in the monitoring of Goal 11 of the Sustainable Development Goals. Spatial indicators are vital tools supporting sustainable urban and regional planning. They are valuable in the generation of spatial data that is critical for priority setting for harmonious and equitable distribution of resources and investments in the territory. This information supports decision-making based on evidence and facilitates effective urban management and the setting of local monitoring mechanisms to assess impact in localized areas.

Proportion of Total Open Public Space = ( (Total surface of open public space + Total surface of land allocated to streets) / Total surface of built up area of the urban agglomeration ) Unit of Measurement: % The method to estimate the area of public space is based on three steps: 1) spatial analysis to delimit the built-up area of the city; 2) estimation of the total open public space and; 3) estimation of the total area allocated to streets. \t1. Spatial analysis to delimit the built-up area. Delimit the built-up area of the urban agglomeration and calculate the total area (square kilometers). \t\t1.1 Satellite imagery: Use of exiting layers of satellite imagery ranging from open sources such as Google Earth and US Geological Survey/NASA imagery Landsat to more sophisticated and higher resolution land cover data sets. Images will be analyzed for the latest available year. \t\t1.2 Delimitation of built-up area of the urban agglomeration: The delimitation of the urban agglomeration refers to the total area occupied by the built-up area and its urbanized open space. The delimitation of the study area distinguishes urban, suburban and rural areas based on the built-up densities. This indicators includes urban (more than 50% built-up density) and suburban areas (between 50% to 10% built-up density (refer to annex 1 \Measurement of the Street Connectivity Index\). \t2. Open public space: mapping and calculation of total areas of open public space within the defined urban boundaries based on the built-up area. \t\t2.1 Definition of open public space: An open public space is related to universal access. Open public spaces include only the following types: \t\t\tParks: open spaces inside a municipality that provide free air recreation and contact with nature. Their principal characteristic is the significant proportion of green area. \t\t\tCivic parks: open spaces created by building agglomeration around an open area, which was later transformed into a representative, civic area. They are characterised by considerable nature, specifically gardens. They are good place for cultural events and passive recreation. \t\t\tSquares: open spaces created by building agglomeration around an open area. Its main characteristics are the significant proportion of architectonic elements and interaction among buildings and the open area. Squares are usually public spaces that are relevant to the city due to their location, territorial development, or cultural importance. \t\t\tRecreational green areas: public green areas that contribute to environmental preservation. All recreational green areas must guarantee accessibility and must be linked to urban areas. Their main functions are ornamental and passive recreation. \t\t\tFacility public areas: open meeting spaces and recreational facilities that are part of city facilities (defined as places that are elementary to all cities; i.e., public libraries, stadium, public sports centres, etc.). These areas have the following characteristics: public property, free transit and access, and both active and passive recreation. (e.g., the public area outside a stadium). \t\t2.2 Inventory of open public space. Information can be obtained from legal documents outlining publicly owned land and well defined land use plans. In some cases where this information is lacking, incomplete or outdated, open sources and communitybased maps, which are increasingly recognized as a valid source of information, can be a viable alternative. \t\t2.3 Computation of total area of open public space. The inventory of open public spaces is digitalized in existing maps and vectorised to allow computation of surfaces. The total of open public area is divided by the total built-up area of the city to obtain the proportion. \t3. Land allocated to streets: calculation of the total area allocated to streets based on sampling techniques as a proportion of the total surface of the built-up area as per definition above. \t\t3.1 Definition of streets. For this indicator, streets are defined as the space used by pedestrian or vehicles in order to go from one place to another in the city and also in order to interact. More and more, local population recognizes streets as public spaces and as an important common of the city. The area of the streets include the carriageway, the median, the roundabouts, the traffic islands, the sidewalk, the cycle tracks, planting zones and storm drainage; in other words, the right of way limited by private properties and/or natural obstacles such as rivers. In informal settlements or slum areas where sidewalks are missing, the main references for limiting the street area are the physical boundaries used to demarcate the private properties. Unpaved roads are also considered as streets. \t\t3.2 Sampling technique for the estimation of land allocated to streets. The estimation of the total area of the street is based on the following methodology: \t\t\ta. Define the boundary of the built-up area. \t\t\tb. Generate the Halton sequence of sample points of the urban area bounding box for an average density of 10 points per Km2. \t\t\tc. Extract the sample points that are within the urban area boundary. \t\t\td. Buffer the points to get sample areas (circles) with an area of 10 Ha each (0.1 Km2). \t\t\te. For each sample area in the sequence: i) check the completeness of the street network using open street maps (OSM cartography on streets) within the sample area, and complete it if necessary comparing it with the most recent satellite imagery of the urban area; ii) define and delimit streets as per definition; iii) measure the street widths on the orthophoto (i.e. Bing) and store it in the OSM data base; iv) download the OSM cartography; v) superimpose (clip) the OSM data with the sample areas; vi) calculate the land allocated to street for each sample area. \t\t\tf. Repeat the process for the following sample areas until the variations are within a certain margin (95% confidence limits). \t\t3.3 Computation of total area of land allocated to streets. The average of the sample areas provide the total land allocated to streets.

Increasing resilience of cities is critical to reduce disaster risk and achieve sustainable development. Cities are also very vulnerable to natural disasters, especially climate-related shocks. Over half of all coastal areas are urbanized and 21 of the worlds 33 megacities lie in coastal flood zones. Coastal cities are particularly affected by sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis and storm surges) due to the undermining natural protective barriers, low levels of development combined with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas and inadequate capacity to adapt. In addition to the impact on communities and non-human species, the unplanned urbanization also undermines the ecosystem services that support much hard urban infrastructure. This type of development also exacerbates urban vulnerability to climate change impacts, including hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. \nLocated mostly in cities where disadvantaged groups are situated and when affordable access is addressed, resilient infrastructures such as health, education, road and other critical infrastructures will have direct impact on reducing inequality and making growth more inclusive and sustainable. \nThe opportunity is that 60% of the area expected to be urban by 2030 remains to be built, indicating that the shape of future cities can be proactively guided into more risk-sensitive development.

Better management of natural resources can themselves strengthen the resilience of the poor, by both reducing the likelihood of natural hazard events and offering resources to help cope with them. These challenges require enhanced vulnerability and impact assessments, mitigation and adaptation plans, resilience building and DRR strategies.

It includes people who are presumed dead although there is no physical evidence. The data on number of deaths and number of missing are mutually exclusive. Affected people: People who are affected by a hazardous event. Comment: People can be affected directly or indirectly. Affected people may experience short-term or long-term consequences to their lives, livelihoods or health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. Directly affected: People who have suffered injury, illness or other health effects; who were evacuated, displaced, relocated; or have suffered direct damage to their livelihoods, economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. Indirectly affected: People who have suffered consequences, other than or in addition to direct effects, over time due to disruption or changes in economy, critical infrastructures, basic services, commerce, work or social, health and physiological consequences. In this indicator, given the difficulties in assessing the full range of all affected (directly and indirectly), UNISDR proposes the use of an indicator that would estimate \directly affected\ as a proxy for the number of affected. This indicator, while not perfect, comes from data widely available and could be used consistently across countries and over time to measure the achievement of the Target B. From the perspective of data availability and measurability, it is proposed to build a composite indicator which consists of \directly affected\, or those who are \tInjured or ill, \tEvacuated, \tRelocated and to measure the number who suffered direct damage to their livelihoods or assets, \tPeople whose houses were damaged or destroyed \tPeople who received food relief aid. Injured or ill: The number of people suffering from physical injuries, trauma or cases of disease requiring immediate medical assistance as a direct result of a hazardous event. Evacuated: The number of people who temporarily moved from where they were (including their place of residence, work places, schools and hospitals) to safer locations in order to ensure their safety. Relocated: The number of people who moved permanently from their homes to new sites due to hazardous event. Note: This definition excludes preventive relocation before the event. People whose houses were damaged or destroyed due to hazardous events: The estimated number of inhabitants previously living in the houses (housing units) damaged or destroyed. All the inhabitants of these houses (housing units) are assumed to be affected being in their dwelling or by direct consequence of the destruction/damage to their housings (housing units). An average number of inhabitants per house (housing unit) in the country can be used to estimate the value. Houses destroyed: Houses (housing units) levelled, buried, collapsed, washed away or damaged to the extent that they are no longer habitable. Houses damaged: Houses (housing units) with minor damage, not structural or architectural, which may continue to be habitable, although they may require some repair or cleaning. People who received food relief aid: The number of persons who received food /nutrition, by government or as humanitarian aid, during or in the aftermath of a hazardous event. Hazardous event: The occurrence of a natural or human-induced phenomenon in a particular place during a particular period of time due to the existence of a hazard. Hazard: A potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon or human activity that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. UNISDR recommends setting NO threshold for recording hazardous event in order to monitor all hazardous events. Small-scale but frequent hazardous events that are not registered in international disaster loss databases account for an important share of damages and losses when they are combined, and often go unnoticed by the national and international community. These events, when accumulated, are often a source of poverty in developing countries but can be effectively addressed by well-designed policies.

Regarding the inclusion of biological and environmental hazards in natural hazards category and whether and how to integrate man-made hazards, UNISDR will discuss the issue with WHO and other organizations (for example, WHO would be in a better position in terms of data, knowledge and relationship with Member States and other stakeholders to monitor biological events including epidemics.

The establishment of protected areas is an important mechanism for achieving this aim, and this indicator serves as a means of measuring progress toward the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of marine ecosystems and their services, in line with obligations under international agreements. Importantly, it is not restricted to any single marine ecosystem type, and so faithfully reflects the intent of SDG target 14.2. Levels of access to protected areas vary among the protected area management categories. Some areas, such as scientific reserves, are maintained in their natural state and closed to any other use. Others are used for recreation or tourism, or even open for the sustainable extraction of natural resources. In addition to protecting biodiversity, protected areas have become places of high social and economic value: supporting local livelihoods; protecting watersheds from erosion; harbouring an untold wealth of genetic resources; supporting thriving recreation and tourism industries; providing for science, research and education; and forming a basis for cultural and other non-material values. This indicator adds meaningful information to, complements and builds from traditionally reported simple statistics of territorial area covered by protected areas, computed by dividing the total protected area within a country by the total territorial area of the country and multiplying by 100.

It is a thematic disaggregation of the multi-purpose indicator for protected area coverage of important sites. Concepts Protected areas, as defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), are clearly defined geographical spaces, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values. Importantly, a variety of specific management objectives are recognised within this definition, spanning conservation, restoration, and sustainable use: \tCategory Ia: Strict nature reserve \tCategory Ib: Wilderness area \tCategory II: National park \tCategory III: Natural monument or feature \tCategory IV: Habitat/species management area \tCategory V: Protected landscape/seascape \tCategory VI: Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources The status \designated\ is attributed to a protected area when the corresponding authority, according to national legislation or common practice (e.g., by means of an executive decree or the like), officially endorses a document of designation. The designation must be made for the purpose of biodiversity conservation, not de facto protection arising because of some other activity (e.g., military). Sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity are identified following globally standard criteria applied at national levels. Two variants of these standard criteria have been applied in all countries to date. The first is for the identification of Important Bird & Biodiversity Areas (IBAs), that is, sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, identified using data on birds, of which >12,000 sites in total have been identified from all of the worlds countries. The second is for the identification of Alliance for Zero Extinction sites (AZEs), that is, sites holding effectively the entire population of at least one species assessed as Critically Endangered or Endangered on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In total, 587 AZE sites have been identified for 920 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, conifers, and reef-building corals.

70,Progress towards sustainable forest management,/15-2-1/,15,indicator,15.2.1,null,null,null,null,unk,null,null,3,FAO,15.2,true,"The definition of SFM by UN GA contains several key aspects, notably that sustainable forest management is a concept which varies over time and between countries, whose circumstances  ecological, social and economic  vary widely, but that it should always address a wide range of forest values, including economic, social and environmental values, and take intergenerational equity into account. \nClearly a simple measure of change in forest area, while essential, and used for target 15.1, is insufficient to monitor sustainable forest management as a whole. The index proposed combines the two indicators at present under consideration (\forest loss\ and \area certified\) with measures of use/degradation (sub-indicator 2), biodiversity conservation (sub-indicator 3) to give a more rounded picture of sustainable forest management. Further \topical\ sub-indicators will be needed to provide a more comprehensive assessment of SFM aspects. The significance of the four sub-indicators may be briefly explained as follows: \n\t1. Trends in forest area are crucial for monitoring SFM: clearly, if there is significant uncontrolled deforestation, forest management is not sustainable. The indicator focuses on change as there is no ideal share of forest in land cover, as the share is determined by history, ecological circumstances and competing land uses. The indicator covers the net effect of the other parts of Target 15.2: \halt deforestation\ and \substantially increase afforestation and reforestation\. However most countries have reliable data on the components of this overall trend (deforestation, afforestation and reforestation), for which separate targets can be specified, if so desired. This component incorporates the concept of \net permanent forest loss \ at present classified \green\ and is also used for Target 15.1 \n\t2. Changes in the stock of biomass are determined by the balance between increase in volume of wood biomass (annual increment) and decrease (natural losses and damage by fire insects etc., and wood harvest). In a sustainably managed forest, increment is more than losses, so that the biomass stock increases, or does not decrease, and carbon is sequestered from the atmosphere. With very few exceptions, a decline in total biomass stocks, even if the forest area does not decrease, implies unsustainable management (and possible degradation). As the wood/carbon ratio is constant, there will be exactly the same trends for carbon stocks as for wood biomass. Therefore a single indicator addresses carbon stocks and flows and trends in growing stock of wood, and may be expressed in m3 of wood or in tons of carbon. \n\t3. Forest areas managed for the conservation of biodiversity are a proxy for trends in forest biodiversity and a clear indication of political will to incorporate biodiversity into forest management. The CBD Aichi Target 11 calls for each country to conserve at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water areas, so this may be taken as a goal for this element. Work is in hand on developing a number of indicators of forest biodiversity, which may be useful in the future. \n\t4. The fourth parameter looks at the area within a country where a key tool for sustainable forest management is applied. The existence of a \forest management plan\ is a necessary tool for evidence based, long term management. Those areas that are certified by third party schemes as being sustainably managed work on the basis of an independently verified management plan. While the latter fulfils a higher standard, it should be pointed out that there are very significant areas of sustainably managed forest which are not certified, either because their owners have chosen not to seek certification (which is voluntary and market-based) or because no credible (or affordable) certification scheme is in place for that area. The latter is true for most tropical countries. For this reason, using \area of certified forest\ as the sole indicator could give a misleading impression.",http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-15.pdf,5,Progress towards sustainable forest management,"By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally.","Sustainable forest management is a central concept for Goal 15 and target 15.1 as well as for target 15.2. It has been formally defined, by the UN General Assembly, as follows: [a] dynamic and evolving concept [that] aims to maintain and enhance the economic, social and environmental values of all types of forests, for the benefit of present and future generations\. (Resolution A/RES/62/98) An \index of sustainable forest management\ with four sub-indicators can be used as a basic indicator of progress towards sustainable forest management by a country. The four sub-indicators are \t1. Annual average percent change in forest area over most recent available 5 year period \t2. Annual average percent change in stock of carbon in above ground biomass over most recent available 5 year period \t3. Share of forest area whose primary designated function is biodiversity conservation, most recent period \t4. Share of forest area under a forest management plan, of which forest area certified under an independent forest management certification scheme, most recent period For each of these components, countries can set national targets, monitor and report on progress. The four sub-indicators will be combined into a single composite index, but targets would be set at the level of sub-indicators. Once targets have been set by national authorities, in terms of the four sub-indicators, and progress measured over an agreed period, countries would assess progress (on track to exceed target, on track to achieve target, progress but at an insufficient rate, no significant overall progress, moving away from target). The final value of the index would be a simple arithmetic average of the values for the four sub-indicators. The use of national targets allows each country to define sustainable forest management for its own specific circumstances, within a coherent international framework. Targets on the sub-indicators can also be set at regional or global levels.",null,null,,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,,null,,null,null,null,null,null,,0,0

This indicator can be used to assess overall changes in the extinction risk of groups of species as a result of these threats and the extent to which threats are being mitigated. \nThe IUCN RLI value ranges from 1 (all species are categorized as Least Concern) to 0 (all species are categorized as Extinct). An intermediate value indicates how far the set of species has moved overall towards extinction. Thus, the IUCN RLI allows comparisons between sets of species in both their overall level of extinction risk (i.e., how threatened they are on average), and in the rate at which this risk changes over time. A downward trend in the IUCN RLI over time means that the expected rate of future species extinctions is worsening (i.e., the rate of biodiversity loss is increasing). An upward trend means that the expected rate of species extinctions is abating (i.e., the rate of biodiversity loss is decreasing), and a horizontal line means that the expected rate of species extinctions is remaining the same, although in each of these cases it does not mean that biodiversity loss has stopped. An upward IUCN RLI trend would indicate that the SDG Target 15.5 of reducing the degradation of natural habitats and protecting threatened species is on track towards halting the loss of biodiversity and thus preventing the extinction of threatened species by 2020. An IUCN RLI value of 1 would indicate that biodiversity loss has been halted. \nThe name \Red List Index\ should not be taken to imply that the indicator is produced as a composite indicator of a number of disparate metrics, in the same way that, e.g., the Multidimensional Poverty Index is compiled. Rather, the RLI is an indicator of trends in species extinction risk, as measured using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, and is compiled from data on changes over time in the Red List Category for each species, excluding any changes driven by improved knowledge or revised taxonomy.",http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-15.pdf,11,Red List Index,"Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity, and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species.","Definition The Red List Index is a multi-purpose indicator which measures the aggregate change in extinction risk across groups of species. It is based on the number of species in each category of extinction risk on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This indicator is expressed as an index ranging from 0 to 1. Concepts Threatened species are those listed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in the categories Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered (i.e., species that are facing a high, very high, or extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the medium-term future). Changes over time in the proportion of species threatened with extinction are largely driven by improvements in knowledge and changing taxonomy. The IUCN Red List Index (RLI) therefore accounts for such changes to yield a more informative indicator than the simple proportion of threatened species. It measures change in aggregate extinction risk across groups of species over time, resulting from genuine improvements or deteriorations in the status of individual species. It can be calculated for any representative set of species that have been assessed for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species at least twice.",null,null,"The IUCN RLI is calculated at a point in time by first multiplying the number of species in each Red List Category by a weight (ranging from 1 for Near Threatened to 5 for Extinct and Extinct in the Wild) and summing these values. This is then divided by a maximum threat score which is the total number of species multiplied by the weight assigned to the Extinct category. This final value is subtracted from 1 to give the IUCN RLI value. see report for mathematical calculation expression The formula requires that: \tExactly the same set of species is included in all time periods, and \tThe only Red List Category changes are those resulting from genuine improvement or deterioration in status (i.e., excluding changes resulting from improved knowledge or taxonomic revisions), and \tData Deficient species be excluded. In many cases, species lists will change slightly from one assessment to the next (e.g., owing to taxonomic revisions). The conditions can therefore be met by retrospectively adjusting earlier Red List categorizations using current information and taxonomy. This is achieved by assuming that the current Red List Categories for the taxa have applied since the set of species was first assessed for the Red List, unless there is information to the contrary that genuine status changes have occurred. Such information is often contextual (e.g., relating to the known history of habitat loss within the range of the species). If there is insufficient information available for a newly added species, it is not incorporated into the IUCN RLI until it is assessed for a second time, at which point earlier assessments are retrospectively corrected by extrapolating recent trends in population, range, habitat and threats, supported by additional information. To avoid spurious results from biased selection of species, RLIs are typically calculated only for taxonomic groups in which all species worldwide have been assessed for the Red List, or for samples of species that have been systematically or randomly selected.",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,,null,,null,null,null,null,null,,0,0

Seizures are the result of confiscation of wildlife or wildlife products by national law enforcement authorities. Seizures occur when law enforcement authorities have suspicion that the wildlife or wildlife product they encounter is obtained or trafficked illegally.

The different wildlife products traded and seized are compared by applying an aggregation measure. Concepts: Wildlife is defined as protected wild species of flora and fauna which are legally traded and included in the CITES Appendices. With the exception of Appendix I species, most protected wildlife is legally traded. Poaching is defined as the illegal taking of wildlife for the purposes of international trade. Illicit trafficking is defined as illegal import or export of wildlife. Export Permits are required to export CITES-listed wildlife by every Member State (defined in Article VI of CITES, which regulates the information export permit shall contain and in Resolution Conf. 8.5, in which the Conference of the Parties to the Convention agreed on the information to be included in an export permitiv). Seizures are the result of confiscation of wildlife or wildlife products by national law enforcement authorities. Seizures occur when law enforcement authorities have suspicion that the wildlife or wildlife product they encounter is obtained or trafficked illegally. Depending on where, when and why national law enforcement authorities seize wildlife and wildlife products, the information about the seized items corresponds more or less to the variables defined by CITES in the export permit. A minimum prerequisite of a seizure report is naming the species (or lowest taxonomic level possible) of the seized specimen. Also the quantity of specimens and the unit of measure are ideally included, as well as the trade term defining the product that is seized. Aggregation measure. The weight and number of seizures cannot be used as an indicator of poaching, because it is meaningless to compare or add the different wildlife products.

Security from violence is a pre-requisite for individuals to enjoy a safe and active life and for societies and economies to develop freely. Intentional homicides occur in all countries of the world and this indicator has a global applicability. Monitoring intentional homicides is necessary to better assess their causes, drivers and consequences and, in the longer term, to develop effective preventive measures. If data are properly disaggregated (as suggested in the ICCS), the indicator can identify the different type of violence associated with homicide: inter-personal (including partner and family-related violence), crime (including organized crime and other forms of criminal activities) and political (including terrorism, hate crime). The interpretation of this indicator is straightforward also for non-specialised users. From Goal 16 TST Working Group: As described above, this composite indicator is comprised of two forms of violent deaths. Intentional homicides occur in all countries of the world and have global applicability, while conflict-related deaths occur in countries with ongoing conflicts/wars. Peace is a much broader concept than violent deaths, however, it is difficult to measure many aspects of peace (threats and the fear of violence, insecurity, and other forms of violence, including damages to persons and property). Deaths due to violence are universally and easily understood, are frequently monitored and are comparable with only minor discrepancies in interpretation, largely due to the finality of death. Monitoring intentional homicides is necessary to better assess their causes and consequences and, in the longer term, to develop effective prevention measures. It is based on statistical data routinely produced by law enforcement authorities and/or public health institutions, with a high degree of international comparability.

Still, they are useful complements to each other as, by construction, they are exclusive and non-overlapping (ie. By design, their conjunction does not double count violent deaths). Intentional homicide is defined as the unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent of cause death or serious injury (Source: International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS), 2015). ICCS recommends that intentional homicides include: \tMurder \tHonour killing \tSerious assault leading to death \tDeath as a result of terrorist activities \tDowry-related killings \tFemicide \tInfanticide \tVoluntary manslaughter \tExtrajudicial killings \tKillings caused by excessive force by law enforcement/state officials Conflict-related deaths refer to those deaths caused by warring parties, including, but not limited to, those caused by traditional battlefield fighting and bombardments (battle-related deaths). The term conflict-related death is broader than the term \battlerelated death\ as it includes killings that amount to war crimes, such as targeting of civilians or of military hors combat, killings associated with a conflict (but not accompanied by a battle between warring parties) such as one-sided killings, pogroms and genocides. Following the ICCS definition (see homicides at left) death as a result of terrorist activities would be included in intentional homicides. For both intentional homicides and conflict-related deaths, rates are defined as the total count in deaths in a calendar year, respectively, divided by the total resident population for the year, expressed per 100,000 population. The denominator (100,000 population) has been adopted globally by law enforcement as the standard for comparable measurement.","Estimated number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population, Estimated number of victims of intentional homicide by sex and age\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","Estimated number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population, Estimated number of victims of intentional homicide by sex and age",,Annual\t\t\t\t\t\t\t,N/A,Annual,,N/A,CRIMESTATSINFO@ic.fbi.gov,FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program Data Collection,null,null,,true,https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\t,"These tables contain statistics for the entire United States. Because not all law enforcement agencies provide data for complete reporting periods, the FBI estimated crime numbers in these presentations. The FBI computes estimates for participating agencies that do not provide 12 months of complete data. For agencies supplying 3 to 11 months of data, the national UCR Program estimates for the missing data by following a standard estimation procedure using the data provided by the agency. If an agency has supplied less than 3 months of data, the FBI computes estimates by using the known crime figures of similar areas within a state and assigning the same proportion of crime volumes to nonreporting agencies. The estimation process considers the following: population size covered by the agency; type of jurisdiction, e.g., police department versus sheriff’s office; and geographic location. Much of the data presented in the Crime in the United States publication are obtained from the Monthly Return of Offenses Known to Police form which is required to participate in the FBI UCR Program. Data sited from the FBI UCR Program’s website regarding the age and sex of a victim of homicide is obtained from the Supplementary Homicide Report (SHR). The SHR provides additional details surrounding the homicide such as victim and offender age, sex, and race, type of weapon, circumstance during a homicide, and the relationship of the victim to the offender. The SHR is not required for participation in the program. Murder victims with unknown age and/or sex are not included in this table. To calculate the estimated number of males, females, and age of the victim, the percent distribution was figured using data supplied to the national UCR Program on the SHR. The resulting figure was then applied to the total estimated number of homicides for the nation.

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) sponsors the survey, and the U.S. Census Bureau serves as the data collection agent. The NPS distinguishes between inmates in custody and prisoners under jurisdiction. To have custody of a prisoner, a state or the BOP must hold that inmate in one of its facilities. To have jurisdiction over a prisoner, the state or BOP must have legal authority over that prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is incarcerated or supervised. The NPS jurisdiction counts include persons held in prisons, penitentiaries, correctional facilities, halfway houses, boot camps, farms, training or treatment centers, and hospitals. Counts also include prisoners who were temporarily absent (less than 30 days), in court, or on work release; housed in privately operated facilities, local jails, or other state or federal facilities; and serving concurrent sentences for more than one correctional authority. The NPS custody counts include all inmates held within a respondent’s facilities, including inmates housed for other correctional facilities. The custody counts exclude inmates held in local jails and in other jurisdictions. With a few exceptions, the NPS custody counts exclude inmates held in privately operated facilities. Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ) - In years between a complete census of local jails, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) conducts the Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ). ASJ uses a stratified probability sample of jail jurisdictions to estimate the number and characteristics of local inmates nationwide. In the sampling design, the jail jurisdictions nationwide are grouped into 10 strata. In 2013-14 and 2015, the 10 strata were defined by two variables: the jail jurisdiction average daily population (ADP), and whether the jurisdiction held at least one juvenile. For 8 of the 10 strata, a random sample of jail jurisdictions was selected. For the remaining two strata, all jurisdictions were included in the sample. One stratum consisted of all jails that were operated jointly by two or more jurisdictions (referred to as multi-jurisdictional jails). The other stratum (referred to as certainty stratum) consisted of all jail jurisdictions that held juvenile inmates at the time of the Census of Jail Inmates (2005 Census for ASJ 2013-14; 2013 Census for ASJ 2015)and had an ADP of 500 or more inmates during the 12 months ending June 30, 2005 (for ASJ 2013-14) or ending December 31, 2013 (for ASJ 2015) or held only adult inmates and had an ADP of 750 or more. BJS obtains data from sampled jail jurisdictions by mailed and web-based survey questionnaires. After follow-up phone calls, the item response rate for jails that responded to the survey was nearly 100% for critical items.

They include legally earned value, money and monetized instruments that are transferred illicitly or value, money and monetized instruments that are acquired through illegal activities, such as the proceeds of crimes, including corruption and tax evasion. They can also capture tax avoidance and trade misinvoicing. Although the UN Economic Commission for Africa, UNDP, Global Financial Integrity and others have produced global country-by-country estimates for illicit financial flows, more work on methodologies would be required. Overview of the main methods of estimating illicit financial flows (adapted from the Mbeki Report of the High-level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows from Africa (http://www.uneca.org/iff)): In terms of the methodologies used to estimate IFFs, several empirical models have been used to estimate both the magnitude of IFFs and their economic implications for developing countries. These models and the analytic methods underlying them deserve further scrutiny. In particular, four methods have dominated the empirical literature: the Hot Money Method, the Dooley Method, the World Bank Residual Method and the IMF Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS)based Trade Mispricing Method. The latter two remain the most widely used. The Hot Money Method records IFFs through net errors and omissions in payment balances. The Dooley Method relies on the privately held foreign assets reported in the balance of payments that do not generate investment income. The World Bank Residual Method estimates IFFs as the difference between the source of funds (external debt and foreign direct investment) and the use of funds (current account deficit and reserves). The Trade Mispricing Model assesses IFFs by looking for disparities arising from overinvoicing of imports and underinvoicing of exports after adjusting for ordinary price differences. In this model, imports are generally recorded after adjusting for the cost of insurance and freight, while exports are usually valued free-on-board. To provide the most thorough estimates of IFFs, Global Financial Integrity has combined the World Bank Residual Method and the Trade Mispricing Model in its computations. ECA has used the Trade Mispricing Model (see Mbeki report). An Overview of the Analytical Methodologies Utilized by Global Financial Integrity to Study Illicit Financial Flows (adapted from their website: http://www.gfintegrity.org/issues/illicit-financial-flows-analytical-methodologies-utilizedglobal-financial-integrity/): Global Financial Integrity (GFI) estimates that nearly US$1 trillion of unrecorded money flows out of developing countries annually. There are three forms of unrecorded money moving across borders: \tCorrupt: Proceeds of bribery and theft by government officials. \tCriminal: Proceeds of drug trading, human trafficking, counterfeiting, contraband, and myriad forms of additional activities. \tCommercial: Proceeds arising from import and export transactions conducted so as to manipulate customs duties, VAT taxes, income taxes, excise taxes, or other sources of government revenues. In analyzing IFFs, GFI utilizes sources of data and analytical methodologies that have been used by international institutions, governments, and economists for decades. Basically, these data sources and methodologies are providing information on gapsgaps in balance of payments data and gaps in trade data. Where recorded sources and uses of funds in balance of payments data do not match, the difference is net errors and omissions, indicating an inflow or outflow that was not recorded. Where bilateral trade data does not match (after adjusting for freight and insurance in the data of the importing country) this indicates reinvoicing of transactions between export from one country and import into another country. Some reviewers of GFIs data sources and analytical methodologies have raised questions, which GFI is pleased to address as follows: \tGFI well recognizes that statistics can be flawed, due to errors in collection, recording, or conveying. Precisely the same point can be made about virtually every other economic analysis ever undertaken. GFI uses the best data available, data that has been collected, reported, and recorded by governments for decades according to international guidelines issued by the IMF. \tThe reliability and accuracy of trade statistics of developing countries are regularly assessed through the IMFs Data Quality Assessment Framework under the Data component of the Reports on Standards and Codes. These ratings show that for all assessed developing countries (about 72) the quality is \very high\ or \high\. \tGFI does not suggest that every single unrecorded transaction is illicit; however, the vast majority of unrecorded transactions are illicit. \tGFI does not use net illicit outflows and illicit inflows. In countries where unrecorded outflows and unrecorded inflows roughly balance, it would be a mistake to consider that such a country has no problem with unrecorded flows. There is no such concept as \net crime.\ Indeed, in GFIs view, illicit outflows and illicit inflows should be added, since both sides of the equation generally produce harm. From UNODC: There is no single, agreed definition of illicit financial flows (IFF), but essentially these are financial flows generated by methods, practices and crimes aiming to transfer financial capital in contravention of national or international laws. When anlyzing IFF the following components are generally included: proceeds of crime, proceeds of corruption (national or international corruption), money laundering (including from proceeds of crime), tax evasion, theft of state assets, and market and regulatory abuses.",null,null,,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,,null,,null,null,null,null,null,,0,0

Children without official identification documents may be denied health care or education. Later in life, the lack of such documentation can mean that a child may enter into marriage or the labour market, or be conscripted into the armed forces, before the legal age. In adulthood, birth certificates may be required to obtain social assistance or a job in the formal sector, to buy or prove the right to inherit property, to vote and to obtain a passport. From Goal 16 TST Working Group: Article 7 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) provides that all children should be registered immediately after birth and have the right from birth to a name and the right to acquire a nationality. Article 8 CRC further provides that, where a child is illegally deprived of some or all of the elements of his or her identity, States Parties shall provide appropriate assistance and protection, with a view to re-establishing speedily his or her identity. This indicator is therefore measured for all children, defined as persons under the age of 18. Where births are not registered, children may be unable to obtain a birth certificate, which can result in denial of access to public services including education, health and social services, despite the human rights obligations of States to provide these without discrimination.

Concepts A National Human Rights Institution is an independent administrative body set up by a State to promote and protect human rights. NHRIs are State bodies with a constitutional and/or legislative mandate to protect and promote human rights. They are part of the State apparatus and are funded by the State. However, they operate and function independently from government. While their specific mandate may vary, the general role of NHRIs is to address discrimination in all its forms, as well as to promote the protection of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. Core functions of NHRIs include complaint handling, human rights education and making recommendations on law reform. Effective NHRIs are an important link between government and civil society, in so far as they help bridge the protection gap between the rights of individuals and the responsibilities of the State. Six models of NHRIs exist across all regions of the world today, namely: Human rights commissions, Human rights ombudsman institutions, Hybrid institutions, Consultative and advisory bodies, Institutes and centres and multiple institutions. An Independent NHRI is an institution with A level accreditation status as benchmarked against the United Nations Paris Principles, which were adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1993.1 The process of accreditation is conducted through peer review by the Sub-Committee on Accreditation (SCA) of the ICC. There are three possible types of accreditation: A: Compliance with Paris Principles B: Observer Status  Not fully in compliance with the Paris Principles or insufficient information provided to make a determination C: Non-compliant with the Paris Principles Accreditation by the ICC entails a determination whether the NHRI is compliant, both in law and practice, with the Paris principles, the principal source of the normative standards for NHRIs, as well as with the General Observations developed by the SCA. Other international standards may also be taken into account by the SCA, including the provisions related to the establishment of national mechanisms in the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment as well as in the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Likewise, the SCA looks at any NHRI-related recommendation from the international human rights mechanisms, notably, the Treaty Bodies, Universal Periodic Review (UPR) and special procedures. The process also looks into the effectiveness and level of engagement with international human rights systems.

Equity has two aspects. The first, vertical equity, concerns the way taxes are distributed among taxpayers with different abilities to pay. The second, horizontal equity, concerns the way taxes are distributed among taxpayers with the same ability to pay. Tax burden measures thus answer broad economic and social questions about the effect of tax policy on the distribution of income and wealth. The distinction regarding national, state and/or local level government is important. For the purposes of monitoring this indicator, the central budget is seen as the focus (even if some of tax payments go to other jurisdictions). When decisions about resources are made, the budgetary central government is a key subsector of the general government sector of the economy. The general government sector consists of resident institutional units that fulfill the functions of government as their primary activity. In all countries, there is an institutional unit of the general government sector particularly important in terms of size and power, in particular the power to exercise control over many other units and entities. The budgetary central government is often a single unit of the central government that encompasses the fundamental activities of the national executive, legislative, and judiciary powers. This component of general government is usually covered by the main (or general) budget. The budgetary central governments revenue and expense are normally regulated and controlled by a ministry of finance, or its functional equivalent, by means of a budget approved by the legislature. Most of the ministries, departments, agencies, boards, commissions, judicial authorities, legislative bodies, and other entities that make up the budgetary central government are not separate institutional units. This is because they generally do not have the authority to own assets, incur liabilities, or engage in transactions in their own right (see GFSM 2014 Chapter 2). There is a widespread acceptance  in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and indeed in Agenda 2030  that multiple sources of finance will be needed to meet the SDGs, and that these will need to work together effectively. This includes a greater role for domestic resources in meeting national development goals, and for interventions in which public resources  including ODA - strengthen domestic capacities for expanding their revenue bases. Indeed, especially in developing countries, vertical fiscal gaps will potentially widen as demands increase for higher public spending  particularly in countries where there is significant pressure on central authorities to provide quality infrastructure and basic services. In many cases the execution of the budgetary central governments proposed budget is constrained by poor revenue administration and/or a lack of a statistical framework for monitoring revenue streams. Given unpredictable and fluctuating levels of revenue in many developing countries, improved revenue statistics will help mitigate any possible budget shortfalls and support the sustainable development of national economies.",http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-17.pdf,4,Proportion of domestic budget funded by domestic taxes,"Strengthen domestic resource mobilization, including through international support to developing countries, to improve domestic capacity for tax and other revenue collection.","Tax burden: Revenue in the form of taxes as defined under government finance statistics (GFS) code 11 as a share of total revenue. In GFS, taxes are classified into six major categories: (i) taxes on income, profits, and capital gains; (ii) taxes on payroll and workforce; (iii) taxes on property; (iv) taxes on goods and services; (v) taxes on international trade and transactions; and (vi) other taxes. (Source: IMF, Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM 2014), Table 4A.1, assessed Dec 28 2015) Concepts Tax burden concept may be disaggregated into the complementary concepts of: direct taxes or taxes that take into account individual circumstances of taxpayers (e.g., taxes on individual and corporate income), which can be calculated from the following detailed GFS revenue classifications: 111 Taxes on income, profits, and capital gains+1131 Recurrent taxes on immovable property+1132 Recurrent taxes on net wealth+1136 Other recurrent taxes on property; and indirect taxes or taxes that do not take into account individual circumstances of taxpayers (e.g., taxes imposed on goods and services), which can be calculated from the following detailed GFS revenue classifications 112 Taxes on payroll and workforce+114 Taxes on goods and services+115 Taxes on international trade and transactions+116 Other taxes. Tax burden is directly related to the wider concept of fiscal burden, which can be derived from combining two GFSM 2014 revenue codes: code 11 Taxes plus code 12, Social Contributions or, alternatively 11+121+122. These concepts can also be found in the 2008 System of National Accounts (2008 SNA). The coverage, timing, and valuation of tax revenue in GFSM 2014 and the 2008 SNA are identical, but the classification systems differ. The 2008 SNA classifies taxes according to their role in economic activitiesnamely: (i) taxes on production and imports (D2); (ii) current taxes on income, wealth, etc. (D5); and (iii) capital taxes (D91). The result is that some categories of taxes in GFS need to be allocated between two of the SNA tax categories according to whether they are payable by producers or final consumers, or whether they are current or capital taxes.

Fixed Internet broadband subscriptions refer to subscriptions to high-speed access to the public Internet (a TCP/IP connection), at downstream speeds equal to, or greater than, 256 kbit/s. This includes cable modem, DSL, fibre-to-the-home/building, other fixed (wired)- broadband subscriptions, satellite broadband and terrestrial fixed wireless broadband. This total is measured irrespective of the method of payment. It excludes subscriptions that have access to data communications (including the Internet) via mobile-cellular networks. It should include fixed WiMAX and any other fixed wireless technologies. It includes both residential subscriptions and subscriptions for organizations. The Internet is a worldwide public computer network. It provides access to a number of communication services including the World Wide Web and carries e-mail, news, entertainment and data files. The indicator is currently broken down by the following subscription speeds: \t256 kbit/s to less than 2 Mbit/s subscriptions: Refers to all fixed broadband Internet subscriptions with advertised downstream speeds equal to, or greater than, 256 kbit/s and less than 2 Mbit/s. \t2 Mbit/s to less than 10 Mbit/s subscriptions: Refers to all fixed -broadband Internet subscriptions with advertised downstream speeds equal to, or greater than, 2 Mbit/s and less than 10 Mbit/s. \tEqual to or above 10 Mbit/s subscriptions (4213_G10).

For purposes of that report, Internet broadband access connections are those in service, over 200 kilobits per second (kbps) in at least one direction, and reported to the FCC through Form 477. Form 477 collects information about fixed Internet access connections in service to end-user premises that are advertised to deliver information to and/or from the end user – that is, in at least one direction – at transfer rates (speeds) above 200 kilobits per second (kbps). Information is collected about the number of connections by the advertised speeds associated with each product subscribed to in the relevant geographic area (census tracts for fixed). Fixed providers report connections by the maximum advertised upload and download speeds. Fixed connections are further categorized by the technology employed by the part of the connection that terminates at the end-user premises. “End users” are residential, business, institutional, or government entities who use services for their own purposes and who do not resell such services to other entities. Facilities-based providers report information about connections they provide directly to their own end-user customers and also connections that they provide to Internet Service Providers for resale to end users. For Form 477 purposes, the facilities-based provider of a fixed broadband connection is the entity that owns the portion of the physical facility (or obtains the right to use dark fiber or satellite transponder capacity as part of its own network) that terminates at the end-user premises and provisions/equips it as broadband, obtains an unbundled network element (UNE), special access line, or other leased facility that terminates at the end-user premises and provisions/equips it as broadband, or provisions/equips broadband over terrestrial wireless spectrum to the end-user premises.

The other wireline category comprises T1/DS1, T3/DS3, and other copper-based connections, not elsewhere categorized, that deliver Internet access service at the end-user premises. Ethernet connections delivering Internet access service are reported in the other wireline category if the connection terminates over copper and in the fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) category if the connection terminates over fiber.

The parameters needed for the calculation of the indicator are: the mean level of dietary energy consumption (DEC); a cut-off point defined as the Minimum Dietary Energy Requirement (MDER); the coefficient of variation (CV) as a parameter accounting for inequality in food consumption; and a skewedness (SK) parameter accounting for asymmetry in the distribution. The DEC as well as the MDER are updated annually, with the former calculated from the FAO Food Balance Sheets. The MDER is calculated as a weighted average of energy requirements according to sex and age class, and is updated each year from UN population ratio data.

Step 1. Calculating the quarterly and annual compound growth rates. A CGR is the growth rate in a time series over a certain amount of time. It is computed as [see report]. A quarterly CGR (CQGR) is calculated by considering periods of three months between ____ and __0, while an annual CGR (CAGR) is calculated by considering a period of 12 months. The importance to consider both CQGR and CAGR derives from the need to take into account the presence of marked seasonal variability in many agricultural prices, with prices growing more or less steadily over the year from their minimum, occurring at harvest period. Step 2. Calculating the weighted average and standard deviation of both CQGR and CAGR. The historic distributions of CGRs are characterized by the mean and the standard deviation of past CGR values. A different distribution of CGRs is computed per each calendar month. Time weights are used to make sure that the more recent past has a higher weight in the calculation of the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of CGRs, so that more recent price dynamics are not overshadowed by past extreme events which could prevent the detection of significant market shocks on prices. Step 4. Computing the indicator of price anomalies. First, the difference between the monthly CGR and the historic average CGR is computed for each month and then normalized with respect to the historic standard deviation. Based on the results, a price anomaly is recorded in each month for which the normalized difference is equal or greater than one. Then, the frequency of price anomalies is computed for both the quarterly and the annual CGRs and the final indicator of price anomalies for month t (________ ) is computed as a weighted average of the frequency of price anomalies in the quarterly CGR and the frequency of price anomalies based on the annual CGR.

Measurement requires information on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death. The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated directly from data collected through vital registration systems, household surveys or other sources. There are often data quality problems, particularly related to the underreporting and misclassification of maternal deaths. Therefore, data are often adjusted in order to take these data quality issues into account. Because maternal mortality is a relatively rare event, large sample sizes are needed if household surveys are used to identify recent maternal deaths in the household (e.g. last year). This may still result in estimates with large confidence intervals, limiting the usefulness for cross_country or over_time comparisons. To reduce sample size requirements, the sisterhood method used in the DHS and multiple indicator surveys (MICS4) measures maternal mortality by asking respondents about the survival of sisters. It should be noted that the sisterhood method results in pregnancy_related mortality: regardless of the cause of death, all deaths occurring during pregnancy, birth or the six weeks following the termination of the pregnancy are included in the numerator of the maternal mortality ratio. Censuses have also included questions about maternal deaths with variable success. Reproductive Age Mortality Studies (RAMOS) is a special study that uses varied sources, depending on the context, to identify all deaths of women of reproductive age and ascertain which of these deaths are maternal or pregnancy_ related. Method of estimation For facility data_based maternal mortality, the denominator is estimated using population projections. WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, the United Nations Population Division and The World Bank have developed a method to adjust existing data in order to take into account these data quality issues and ensure the comparability of different data sources. This method involves assessment of data for completeness and, where necessary, adjustment for underreporting and misclassification of deaths as well as development of estimates through statistical modelling for countries with no reliable national level data. Data on maternal mortality and other relevant variables are obtained through databases maintained by WHO, the United Nations Population Division, UNICEF, and The World Bank. Data available from countries varies in terms of source and methods. Given the variability of the sources of data, different methods are used for each data source in order to arrive at country estimates that are comparable and permit regional and global aggregation. Currently, only about one third of all countries/territories have reliable data available and do not need additional estimations. For about half of the countries included in the estimation process, country_reported estimates of maternal mortality are adjusted for the purposes of comparability of the methodologies. For the remainder of countries/territories  those with no appropriate maternal mortality data__a statistical model is employed to predict maternal mortality levels. However, the calculated point estimates with this methodology might not represent the true levels of maternal mortality.

Births attended by skilled health personnel = (number of births attended by skilled health personnel)/(total number of live births) x 100.

Convenience sampling is not appropriate. The sample size should be adequate to show with 95% confidence HBsAg prevalence of less than 1% with a precision of  0.5%. The target age is 5_years_old. Sampling 4  6 year olds may be appropriate. The serosurvey is cross sectional and therefore a point estimate time. The shorter time periods of data collection are therefore preferred. Data on HBV birth dose exposure and B3 completion are drawn from official records. Where these are not available testing for HBsAb may be considered for the serosurvey. This is less preferable as it is more costly, but can also be done in addition. Specimen collection and transportation should be appropriate to minimize bias though specimen degradation in rural and remote areas. Where possible, it is advantageous to collect blood specimens for ELISA laboratory testing because the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) is higher than for rapid tests. However in some locations only rapid tests will be available hence test selection is resource dependent. This should be considered in designing overall study methodology.

A brief intervention is a structured therapy of short duration aimed at assisting an individual to cease or reduce the use of a psychoactive substance or to deal with other life issues (WHO). \tContingency management refers to psychosocial interventions that provide a system of incentives and disincentives designed to make drug use less attractive and abstinence more attractive (NIDA). \tCognitive behavioural therapy refers to psychosocial interventions aimed at helping patients recognize, avoid and cope with the situations in which they are most likely to use drugs (adapted from NIDA). \tMotivational interviewing refers to a counselling and assessment technique that follows a non-confrontational approach to questioning people about difficult issues like alcohol and drug use, assisting them to make positive decisions aimed at reducing or stopping such use (ODCCP). Social rehabilitation and aftercare include a cluster of interventions such as vocational training, social assistance, educational activities, rehabilitation and aftercare. \tVocational training and income-generation support refers to activities aimed at providing participants with the skills and opportunities to engage in meaningful employment and sustainably support themselves and their families. \tSocial assistance refers to the many ways in which professionals and nonprofessionals can support the social and psychological well-being of drug users with a view to improving both the quality and duration of their lives (WHO, Guidelines for the Psychosocially Assisted Pharmacological Treatment of Opioid Dependence, 2009). \tEducational activities on the risks posed by drug use refer to sessions aimed at informing and counselling people about the consequences of drug use, in other words, the ways in which such use affects physical and mental health, behavioural control and interpersonal relationships.

The proportion of demand for family planning satisfied (met need for contraception) indicator enables assessment of family planning programmes and progress in providing contraceptive services to women who wish to avoid getting pregnant. Access to family planning provides women and their partners opportunities to make decisions about family size and timing of pregnancies. This contributes to maternal and child health by preventing unintended pregnancies and pregnancies that are too closely spaced, which are at higher risk for poor obstetrical outcomes. Unmet need for family planning shows the gap between womens reproductive intentions and their access to or use of contraceptives. The CPR provides an estimate of contraceptive use in a population. Both the unmet need for family planning and CPR indicators are used for tracking progress towards the MDG 5 target 5B of achieving universal access to reproductive health. (WHO, 2011) From UNFPA: The contraceptive prevalence rate, which serves as a proxy measure of access to reproductive health services, is useful for tracking progress towards the target of achieving universal access to reproductive health, especially when the indicator is considered in conjunction with information about womens knowledge of family planning or accessibility, and the quality of family planning services. Information on contraceptive prevalence complements the indicator of unmet need for family planning. The sum of contraceptive prevalence and unmet need determines the total demand for contraception. Unlike the unmet need indicator, contraceptive prevalence does not take into account whether women or couples do or do not desire additional children. This makes the indicator more difficult to interpret than unmet need because contraceptive prevalence rates vary across societies with vastly different preferred family sizes. For the same reason, it is difficult to specify the desired target for contraceptive prevalence rates.",http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-3.pdf,19,Proportion of women of reproductive age (aged 15-49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods,"By 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes.","From WHO: Percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who are sexually active and who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods.From Population Division/DESA, United Nations: Percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods.From UNFPA: The contraceptive prevalence rate is the percentage of women of reproductive age who are currently using, or whose sexual partner is currently using, at least one contraceptive method, regardless of the method used. Concepts Women of reproductive age include all women of reproductive age (15-49) who are married or in consensual union. Contraceptive methods include modern and traditional methods. Modern methods of contraception include female and male sterilization, oral hormonal pills, intra-uterine devices (IUD), male condoms, injectables, implants (including Norplant), vaginal barrier methods, female condoms, and emergency contraception. Traditional methods of contraception include the rhythm method (periodic abstinence), withdrawal, lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) and folk methods.",Percentage of current use of any method of contraception among US women aged 15-44,Percent of all US women aged 15-44 years using any method of contraception in the month of interview in the National Survey of Family Growth,"Number of women with family planning demand who use modern methods / Total number of women in need of family planning Method of measurement Household surveys include a series of questions to measure modern contraceptive prevalence rate and demand for family planning.Total demand for family planning is defined as the sum of the number of women of reproductive age (1549 years) who are married or in a union and who are currently using, or whose sexual partner is currently using, at least one contraceptive method, and the unmet need for family planning. Unmet need for family planning is the proportion of women of reproductive age (1549 years) either married or in a consensual union, who are fecund and sexually active but who are not using any method of contraception (modern or traditional), and report not wanting any more children or wanting to delay the birth of their next child for at least two years. Included are: (i) all pregnant women (married or in a consensual union) whose pregnancies were unwanted or mistimed at the time of conception; (ii) all postpartum amenorrhoeic women (married or in consensual union) who are not using family planning and whose last birth was unwanted or mistimed; (iii) all fecund women (married or in consensual union) who are neither pregnant nor postpartum amenorrhoeic, and who either do not want any more children (want to limit family size), or who wish to postpone the birth of a child for at least two years or do not know when or if they want another child (want to space births), but are not using any contraceptive method.From Population Division/DESA, United Nations: The numerator is the percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years old) who are currently using, or whose sexual partner is currently using, at least one modern contraceptive method.

An important limitation, though, of the indicators used in MDG monitoring is that they were only with reference to women of reproductive age who are married or in a union. The indicators missed women who are not married but who are exposed to the risk of pregnancy. See http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mdg/Metadata.aspx The proposed indicator limits the numerator to women who are using a modern method of family planning.

The numerator is the number of live births to women aged 15-19 years, and the denominator is an estimate of exposure to childbearing by women aged 15-19 years. The numerator and the denominator are calculated differently for civil registration and survey and census data. Civil registration: In the case of civil registration the numerator is the registered number of live births born to women aged 15-19 years during a given year, and the denominator is the estimated or enumerated population of women aged 15-19 years. Survey data: In the case of survey data, the adolescent birth rate is generally computed on the basis of retrospective birth histories. The numerator refers to births to women who were 15-19 years of age at the time of the birth during a reference period before the interview, and the denominator to person_years lived between the ages of 15 and 19 years by the interviewed women during the same reference period. Whenever possible, the reference period corresponds to the five years preceding the survey. The reported observation year corresponds to the middle of the reference period. For some surveys, no retrospective birth histories are available and the estimate is based on the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the survey. Census data: With census data, the adolescent birth rate is generally computed on the basis of the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the enumeration. The census provides both the numerator and the denominator for the rates. In some cases, the rates based on censuses are adjusted for under_registration based on indirect methods of estimation. For some countries with no other reliable data, the own_children method of indirect estimation provides estimates of the adolescent birth rate for a number of years before the census (See: http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Metadata.aspx, accessed 19 October 2009.) If numbers are available, adolescent fertility at ages under 15 years can also be computed. Method of estimation The United Nations Population Division compiles and updates data on adolescent fertility rates for MDG monitoring. Estimates based on civil registration are provided when the country reports at least 90% coverage and there is reasonable agreement between civil registration estimates and survey estimates. Survey estimates are provided only when there is no reliable civil registration. Given the restrictions of the United Nations MDG database, only one source is provided by year and country. In such cases precedence is given to the survey programme conducted most frequently at the country level, with other survey programmes using retrospective birth histories, census and other surveys in that order.

Possible scores on the approaches to learning scale range from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating that a child exhibits positive learning behaviors more often. The interpersonal skills scale is based on teachers reports on the student’s skill in forming and maintaining friendships; getting along with people who are different; comforting or helping other children; expressing feelings, ideas, and opinions in positive ways; and showing sensitivity to the feelings of others. Possible scores on the interpersonal skills scale range from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating that a child interacted with others in a positive way more often. The self-control scale is based on teachers reports on the student’s ability to control behavior by respecting the property rights of others, controlling temper, accepting peer ideas for group activities, and responding appropriately to pressure from peers. Possible scores on the self-control scale range from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating that a child exhibited behaviors indicative of self-control more often. Reading score reflects performance on questions measuring basic skills (print familiarity, letter recognition, beginning and ending sounds, rhyming words, and word recognition); vocabulary knowledge; and reading comprehension, including identifying information specifically stated in text (e.g., definitions, facts, and supporting details), making complex inferences from texts, and considering the text objectively and judging its appropriateness and quality. Possible scores for the reading assessment range from 0 to 120. Mathematics score reflects performance on questions on number sense, properties, and operations; measurement; geometry and spatial sense; data analysis, statistics, and probability (measured with a set of simple questions assessing children’s ability to read a graph); and prealgebra skills such as identification of patterns. Possible scores for the mathematics assessment range from 0 to 113.

In the PIAAC PS-TRE framework, PS-TRE is defined as: \using digital technology, communication tools, and networks to acquire and evaluate information, communicate with others, and perform practical tasks.\ PS-TRE measures skills and abilities that are required for solving problems while operating in a technology-rich environment. Specifically, it assesses the cognitive processes of problem solving—goal setting, planning, selecting, evaluating, organizing, and communicating results. The environment in which PS-TRE assesses these processes is meant to reflect the reality that digital technology has revolutionized access to information and communication capabilities over the past decades. In particular, the Internet has immensely increased instantaneous access to large amounts of information in multiple formats and has expanded capabilities of instant voice, text, visual, and graphic communications across the globe. In order to effectively operate in this environment, it is necessary to have mastery of foundational computer (ICT) skills, including (a) skills associated with manipulating input and output devices (e.g., the mouse, keyboard, and digital displays), (b) awareness of concepts and knowledge of how the environment is structured (e.g., files, folders, scrollbars, hyperlinks, and different types of menus or buttons), and (c) the ability to interact effectively with digital information (e.g., how to use commands such as save, delete, open, close, move, highlight, submit, and send). Such interaction involves familiarity with electronic texts, images, graphics and numerical data, as well as the ability to locate, evaluate, and critically judge the validity, accuracy, and appropriateness of accessed information. These skills constitute the core aspects of the PIAAC PS-TRE assessment. Problem Solving in Technology-Rich Environments items present tasks of varying difficulty to be performed in simulated software applications using commands and functions commonly found in the technology environments of email, web pages, and spreadsheets. These tasks range from purchasing particular goods or services online and finding interactive health information to managing personal information and business finances.

The assessment exercises and scoring criteria were developed by a committee of civics educators and curriculum experts to capture the goals of the framework. The framework, which describes the goals of the civics assessment and what kind of exercises it ought to feature, was created by the Board through a comprehensive national process involving educators, researchers, measurement experts, administrators, and members of the general public. The NAEP Civics Standing Committee was instrumental in developing the assessment, guided by the framework. The framework describes the types of texts and questions to be included in the assessment, as well as how the questions should be designed and scored. The framework recommends that the assessment should be organized around three main components: 1) Knowledge; 2) Intellectual and participatory skills; 3) Civic dispositions.

Moreover, since FGM/C is regarded as a traditional practice prejudicial to the health of children and is, in most cases, performed on minors, it violates the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Existing national legislation in many countries also include explicit bans against FGM/C. \n\nFrom WHO: \n Female genital mutilation (FGM) comprises all procedures that involve the partial or total removal of external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons [1]. Although it is internationally recognized as a violation of human rights (including: the right to non-discrimination on the grounds of sex; the right to life; the right to the highest attainable standard of health; the right to freedom From torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment; and the rights of the child), and legislation to prohibit the procedure has been put in place in many countries, the practice has still been documented. \nWHO classifies FGM into four types: [1] \n\tType I: Partial or total removal of the clitoris and/or the prepuce (clitoridectomy). \n\tType II: Partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora (excision). \n\tType III: Narrowing of the vaginal orifice with the creation of a covering seal by cutting and appositioning the labia minora and/or the labia majora, with or without excision of the clitoris (infibulation). \n\tType IV: All other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, for example: pricking, pulling, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterization. \nThe removal of or damage to healthy, normal genital tissue interferes with the natural functioning of the body and causes several immediate and long-term health consequences.",http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-5.pdf,10,"Proportion of girls and women aged 15-49 years who have undergone female genital mutilation/cutting, by age","Eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation.",From UNICEF: This indicator provides the proportion of girls and women aged 15 to 49 years who have undergone female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C).

The standard measure of womens political participation and involvement in decision-making, used to track progress for the Millennium Development Goals, was the proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments. In many respects, the existence and quality of this data has meant that other areas of political participation have not been paid sufficient attention. \nMeasuring womens participation in local government is an additional, but equally important measure of womens political participation and decision-making, because of the responsibilities of local governments and the significantly higher number of opportunities (that is seats) available to women candidates at this level.

Part (a) and part (b) cannot be seen as two different indicators, they rather provide two complementary information. Plus, they can be computed using (almost) the same data, the main difference between the 2 parts being only the denominator. Definition of agricultural land: Since Target 1.4 explicitly refers to equal rights on economic resources, the proposed indicator focuses on land that can be used as a productive resource for livelihood development, thus the focus on agricultural land. The focus on land as productive resource (or for livelihood development) helps deriving indication on empowerment and advancement towards poverty reduction, compared to lands used for other purposes that are not economically and livelihood-related. This is particularly true in developing countries where poverty reduction strategies are necessarily linked to agricultural development. The term agricultural land is used to indicate land used for farming, livestock and forestry activities. This emphasizes the importance to monitor ownership/secure rights on land of farm-based livelihood people as well as people whose main source of livelihood is livestock and forestry. Similarly the term agricultural population has to be intended in a broad sense  i.e. including people living out of farming, livestock and forestry, with land rights or without (landless). Definition of ownership and rights over land: The landowner is the legal owner of the land. Definitions of ownership may vary across countries and surveys. For instance, documented ownership means that ownership is verified through title or deed, while reported ownership relies on individuals own judgment. Reported ownership may be more appropriate in countries where a formal registration system is not in place. Additionally, in some countries, particularly where land private ownership is not applicable, it is more appropriate to investigate rights over land using proxies able to capture individuals capability to control and take decisions over the land. This may include settings where customary rights prevail as opposed to individual ownership. Proxies of such \bundle of rights\ may include the right to sell, to bequeath or the right to decide how to use the land. Since the definition of ownership and land rights has to take into account what is more relevant in the country, the indicator will need to be complemented with metadata that specify what definition(s) of ownership or rights over land is/are employed. Tenure Type Finally and most importantly, this indicator has to be disaggregated by type of tenure. Therefore, the data collection methodology should always include a question on land tenure. Land tenure refers to the arrangements or rights under which people have access to land, and it is one of the key elements to tenure security.5 There are different formal and informal tenure systems around the world and the distinction between legal and non-legal tenure is often blurred. When available, the indicator shall also be disaggregated by documented tenure rights. The FAO World Census of Agriculture encourages countries to use country-specific types of tenure whilst ensuring the possibility to classify ex-post under the following broad categories: 1) legal ownership or legal owner-like possession; 2) Non-legal ownership or non-legal owner-like possession; 3) Rented land from someone else; 4) Various other types of land tenure. Broadly speaking, legal ownership or legal owner-like possession describes land rights that provide statutory security of tenure. This may be done through a formal land title system, but may also include certain forms of customary land tenure arrangements where land rights are registered or certified in some way. The following types of tenure arrangements may be included under this heading: \tOwnership is certified through a title, which gives the individual the right to determine the nature and extent of the use of the land. \tLand is held under conditions that enable it to be operated as if legally owned. E.g., the land is operated under hereditary tenure, perpetual lease, or long-term lease, with nominal or no rent. \tThe land is held under a tribal, communal, or traditional form of tenure, which is legally recognized by the state. Such arrangements usually involve land being held on a tribal, village, kindred or clan basis, with land ownership being communal in character but with certain individual rights being held by virtue of membership in the social unit. Such arrangements can be formalized through the establishment of legal procedures to identify the communitys land and to manage the land rights of community members.",null,null,"We propose using the total agricultural population as denominator of part (a), instead of the total population, because ownership or right-security over agricultural land is obviously relevant only for the people whose livelihood rely on agriculture.

This indicator is also known as water withdrawal intensity. The indicator builds on MDG indicator 7.5 and also accounts for environmental water requirements.This indicator provides an estimate of pressure by all sectors on the countrys renewable freshwater resources. A low level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors is marginal in relation to the resources, and has therefore little potential impact on the sustainability of the resources or on the potential competition between users. A high level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors represents a substantial share of the total renewable freshwater resources, with potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources and potential situations of conflicts and competition between users. Total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) are expressed as the sum of internal and external renewable water resources. The terms water resources and water withdrawal are understood here as freshwater resources and freshwater withdrawal. Internal renewable water resources are defined as the long-term average annual flow of rivers and recharge of groundwater for a given country generated from endogenous precipitation. External renewable water resources refer to the flows of water entering the country, taking into consideration the quantity of flows reserved to upstream and downstream countries through agreements or treaties (and, where available, the reduction of flow due to upstream withdrawal). Total freshwater withdrawal (TWW) is the volume of freshwater extracted from its source (rivers, lakes, aquifers) for agriculture, industries and municipalities. It is estimated at the country level for the following three main sectors: agriculture, municipalities (including domestic water withdrawal) and industries. Freshwater withdrawal includes primary freshwater (not withdrawn before), secondary freshwater (previously withdrawn and returned to rivers and groundwater) and fossil groundwater. It does not include non-conventional water, i.e. direct use of treated wastewater, direct use of agricultural drainage water and desalinated water. TWW is in general calculated as being the sum of total water withdrawal by sector minus direct use of wastewater, direct use of agricultural drainage water and use of desalinated water. Environmental water requirements (Env.) are established in order to protect the basic environmental services of freshwater ecosystems. Methods of computation of Env. are extremely variable. For the purpose of the SDG indicator, Env. are expressed as a percentage of the available water resources.

For cooking and heating, households typically rely on solid fuels (such as wood, charcoal, biomass) or kerosene paired with inefficient technologies (e.g. open fires, stoves, space heaters or lamps). It is well known that reliance on such inefficient energy for cooking, heating and lighting is associated with high levels of household (indoor) air pollution. The use of inefficient fuels for cooking alone is estimated to cause over 4 million deaths annually, mainly among women and children. This is more than TB, HIV and malaria combined. These adverse health impacts can be avoided by adopting clean fuels and technologies for all main household energy end-or in some circumstances by adopting advanced combustion cook stoves (i.e. those which achieve the emission rates targets provided by the WHO guidelines) and adopting strict protocols for their safe use. Given the importance of clean and safe household energy use as a human development issue, universal access to energy among the technical practitioner community is currently taken to mean access to both electricity and clean fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting. For this reason, clean cooking forms part of the universal access objective under the UN Secretary Generals Sustainable Energy for All initiative.",http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-7.pdf,4,Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology,"By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services.","The percentage of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology at the household level.

This single measure captures a good part of the lack of access to clean cooking fuels, but fails to collect data on type of device or technology is used for cooking, and also fails to capture other polluting forms of energy use in the home such as those used for lighting and heating. New evidence-based normative guidance from the WHO ( i.e. WHO Guidelines for indoor air quality guidelines: household fuel combustion), highlights the importance of addressing both fuel and the technology for adequately protecting public health. These guidelines provide technical recommendations in the form of emissions targets for as to what fuels and technology (stove, lamp, and so on) combinations in the home are clean. These guidelines also recommend against the use of unprocessed coal and discourage the use kerosene (a non-solid but highly polluting fuel) in the home. They also recommend that all major household energy end uses (e.g. cooking, space heating, lighting) use efficient fuels and technology combinations to ensure health benefits. For this reason, the technical recommendations in the WHO guidelines, access to modern cooking solution in the home will be defined as access to clean fuels and technologies rather than access to non-solid fuels.

Persons who were waiting to be recalled to a job from which they had been laid off need not have been looking for work to be classified as unemployed. The civilian labor force comprises all persons classified as employed or unemployed. The CPS uses a set of six questions to identify persons with disabilities.

The collection of these data is sponsored by the Department of Labors Office of Disability Employment Policy. Statistics based on the CPS are subject to both sampling and nonsampling error. When a sample, rather than the entire population, is surveyed, there is a chance that the sample estimates may differ from the true population values they represent. The component of this difference that occurs because samples differ by chance is known as sampling error, and its variability is measured by the standard error of the estimate. There is about a 90-percent chance, or level of confidence, that an estimate based on a sample will differ by no more than 1.6 standard errors from the true population value because of sampling error. BLS analyses are generally conducted at the 90-percent level of confidence. The CPS data also are affected by nonsampling error. Nonsampling error can occur for many reasons, including the failure to sample a segment of the population, inability to obtain information for all respondents in the sample, inability or unwillingness of respondents to provide correct information, and errors made in the collection or processing of the data. Additional information about the reliability of data from the CPS and estimating standard errors is available at www.bls.gov/cps/documentation.htm#reliability. CPS estimates are controlled to population totals that are available by age, sex, race, and Hispanic ethnicity. These controls are developed by the Census Bureau and are based on complete population counts obtained in the decennial census. In the years between decennial censuses, they incorporate the latest information about population change (births, deaths, and net international migration). As part of its annual update of population estimates, the Census Bureau introduces adjustments to the total population controls. The updated controls typically have a negligible impact on unemployment rates and other ratios. The estimates of the population of persons with a disability are not controlled to independent population totals of persons with a disability because such data are not available. Without independent population totals, sample-based estimates are more apt to vary from one time period to the next.

Indicator is straightforward to interpret, as it gives the headcount of child labourers at national, regional and global levels. \n\n From UNICEF: \n Children around the world are routinely engaged in paid and unpaid forms of work that are not harmful to them. However, children are considered to be involved in child labour when they are either too young to work or are involved in activities harmful to their health and development. Childrens involvement in hazardous work can compromise their physical, mental, social and educational development. \nThe issue of child labour is guided by three main international conventions: ILO Convention No. 138 concerning minimum age for admission to employment and Recommendation No. 146 (1973); ILO Convention No. 182 concerning the prohibition and immediate action for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour and Recommendation No. 190 (1999); and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (Article 32), including its Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. These conventions frame the concept of child labour and form the basis for child labour legislation enacted by countries that are signatories. \nAs per the 2008 Resolution concerning Statistics of Child Labour, the operation definition of child labour is based on number of hours spent working and working conditions, and encompasses both engagement in economic activities as well as household chores.",http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-8.pdf,13,"Proportion and number of children aged 5-17 years engaged in child labour, by sex and age","Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms.","From ILO: The term child labour reflects the engagement of children in prohibited work and, more generally, in types of work to be eliminated as socially and morally undesirable as guided by national legislation, the ILO Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138), and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182), their respective supplementing Recommendations (Nos 146 and 190), and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The statistical measurement framework for child labour is structured around (i) the age of the child; (ii) the productive activities by the child, including their nature and the conditions under which these are performed, and the duration of engagement by the child in such activities. For the purpose of statistical measurement, children engaged in child labour include all persons aged 5 to 17 years who, during a specified time period, were engaged in one or more of the following categories of activities: \t(a) worst forms of child labour, (as described in paragraphs 1730, 18th ICLS resolution); \t(b) employment below the minimum age, (as described in paragraphs 32 and 33 of the 18th ICLS resolution); and \t(c) hazardous unpaid household services, (as described in paragraphs 36 and 37 of the 18th ICLS resolution), applicable where the general production boundary is used as the measurement framework.

As technologies evolve and as more and more countries will deploy and commercialize more advanced mobilebroadband networks (4G, 5G etc.), the indicator will include further breakdowns. ITU collects data for this indicator through an annual questionnaire from national telecommunication regulatory authorities or Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Ministries, who collect the data from licensed mobile-cellular operators.
